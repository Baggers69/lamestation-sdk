TileStudio Content Toolchain
============================

What good is a game without content?

LameStation was originally intended to use TileStudio for this purpose.

* [http://tilestudio.sourceforge.net/](http://tilestudio.sourceforge.net/)

A complete Windows toolchain has been created (which is being ported to Linux)
that allows graphics to be drawn all in one place and imported into a Spin
project.

TileStudio is an amazing application (super amazing), but it doesn't appear
to be maintained anymore. I made attempts to contact the author with no avail.

For this reason, there is interest in moving the toolchain to Tiled, which is
another great application that is also cross-platform.

I'm not sure how to manage the level export business though, and tileset baking
is not as well supported as with TileStudio.
